# QuickCaptcha
Python bot built using imageAi, and pyautogui to solve image-based captchas

## Purpose
The idea behind QuickCaptcha was to build something that would allow us to step outside of our comfort zone and explore the world of machine-learning and artificial intelligence. Although we lacked a formal understanding and education in AI/ML, this project helped us forge a baseline for what goes behind building an AI/ML model.
